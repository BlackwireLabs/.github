# Entroxx Development

Entroxx Development is a small project focused on **embedded systems** and **microcontroller-based development**.  
We build practical, efficient projects using Arduino and ESP32, with an emphasis on real-world applications.

---

## What We Build
- Arduino-based projects  
- ESP32 systems (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / IoT)  
- Sensors, automation, and control logic  
- Hardware–software integration  

---

## Tech Stack
- Arduino (C/C++)  
- ESP32  
- Serial, I2C, SPI communication  
- Sensors & modules  
- Linux-based development environments  

---

## Philosophy
Simple designs. Clean code. Real hardware.  
Projects that work in the real world — not just on a screen.
